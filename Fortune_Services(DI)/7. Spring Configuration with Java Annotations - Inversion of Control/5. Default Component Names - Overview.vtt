<v Instructor>Hey, in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02.722 --> 00:00:04.635
we're gonna learn how to use components

3
00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:06.552
in the default bean id.

4
00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:10.466
Well, so far we've already learned

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:14.786
how to specify the bean id in the component annotation.

6
00:00:14.786 --> 00:00:16.410
So with our previous example,

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.986
we had tennis coach

8
00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:19.914
and we have at component,

9
00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:22.243
and we give that silly coach.

10
00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:24.091
That's the bean id that we'll use

11
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.674
in our application.

12
00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.277
So we can actually remove the actual bean id

13
00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:36.526
and let Spring generate a default bean id.

14
00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:40.019
The default bean id is basically the class name

15
00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.898
and they simply make the first letter lowercase.

16
00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:46.887
As an example, if we are a class of tennis coach

17
00:00:46.887 --> 00:00:48.484
with a capital t,

18
00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:51.365
then if we don't specify a bean id,

19
00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:54.631
the default bean id will be tennis coach

20
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:56.214
with a lowercase t.

21
00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.293
Okay, so let's kind of walk through this

22
00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.311
with a code example.

23
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.143
So notice here I have tennis coach

24
00:01:03.143 --> 00:01:04.894
and I have at component.

25
00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:08.977
Note here, I didn't explicitly specify a bean id.

26
00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:12.685
So again, we have the class name of tennis coach,

27
00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:15.054
our default bean id will be tennis coach

28
00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:16.288
with a lowercase t,

29
00:01:16.288 --> 00:01:18.466
so they'll take the first letter of the class

30
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.766
and make it lowercase.

31
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:24.072
Now let's look at how we could use this in code now.

32
00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:25.982
In our code to actually retrieve the bean

33
00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:27.410
from the container,

34
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.337
I'd say context get bean,

35
00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:31.362
and I give the default bean id,

36
00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:32.432
which is tennis coach,

37
00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:34.483
which starts with a lowercase t,

38
00:01:34.483 --> 00:01:36.128
and that'll actually give me the bean

39
00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:38.023
from the Spring container.

40
00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:40.985
So again, notice here we're using the default bean id

41
00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:45.037
since our class didn't explicitly specify a bean id.

42
00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.203
And that's pretty much it.

43
00:01:47.203 --> 00:01:48.689
So what we'll do in the next video

44
00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.393
is we'll actually move into Eclipse

45
00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:52.609
and we'll actually work through this example,

46
00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.169
and we'll see how we can actually modify our code

47
00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:56.900
to make use of the default bean id,

48
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.633
and then also retrieve it from the container.

49
00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:02.466
So I'll see you in the next video.
