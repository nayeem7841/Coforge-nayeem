00:00:01.284 --> 00:00:02.314
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02.314 --> 00:00:03.579
and move into Eclipse.

3
00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:05.049
And what I'd like to do in this video,

4
00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.217
is that we're actually gonna set up a new project,

5
00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:09.117
and copy over our Spring JARs.

6
00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:11.068
I like to keep things separate,

7
00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:13.859
just so we're not putting everything into one project.

8
00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.143
Also, it's a good practice,

9
00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:17.409
to set up a couple of projects also.

10
00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.167
Just so you can kind of remember everything.

11
00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.866
So the first thing I'm gonna do here

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.853
is we're actually gonna go through and create a new project.

13
00:00:25.853 --> 00:00:28.005
So I'll go to File, New.

14
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.422
And I'll select Java Project.

15
00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:34.094
And then for the project name

16
00:00:34.094 --> 00:00:36.844
I'll say spring-demo-annotations.

17
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:43.395
And I'll keep all the other defaults here,

18
00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:47.308
and I'll go ahead and click on the Finish button.

19
00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:49.272
Okay, great so we have this new project up top

20
00:00:49.272 --> 00:00:50.655
called spring-demo-annotations.

21
00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:52.405
It's empty right now.

22
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.262
What I like to do is copy over the Spring JARs.

23
00:00:56.262 --> 00:00:58.509
And so I'll actually use that previous project

24
00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:00.759
that we already had set up.

25
00:01:01.964 --> 00:01:03.682
So the project of spring-demo-one

26
00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:06.541
that's the one that we've used in our previous videos.

27
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.940
I actually wanna copy the lib directory

28
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.690
from spring-demo-one.

29
00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:15.906
And I simply just do a right-click and choose Copy.

30
00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:21.209
And then I'll move up to spring-demo-annotations

31
00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:23.445
that's the new project that we just created.

32
00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:25.471
And I'll paste those files there.

33
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:28.971
So I'll do a right-click and choose Paste.

34
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.698
Okay great so now we've pasted this

35
00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:36.135
new directory over there lib

36
00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:39.117
and this is part of our spring-demo-annotations.

37
00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:40.971
This is great but we need to do one more thing.

38
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:42.829
We actually need to add these JAR files

39
00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.011
to our project class path.

40
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:47.328
So we'll go ahead and select the project up top

41
00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:49.026
spring-demo-annotations.

42
00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:53.040
And I'll right-click and choose Properties.

43
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.290
Because I actually need to setup

44
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.623
my Build Path at this point.

45
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.150
And over on the left hand side

46
00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:08.075
let's choose Java Build Path.

47
00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:11.742
Then in the center we'll click on Libraries.

48
00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:16.874
And then we'll move over and then we'll choose Add JARs.

49
00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:21.744
And let's expand the folder here for spring-demo-annotations

50
00:02:21.744 --> 00:02:24.444
that's the new project that we just created.

51
00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.444
And we'll expand that lib directory.

52
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:30.088
And so I'll just go through in that lib directory

53
00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:32.328
I'll select all of those JAR files.

54
00:02:32.328 --> 00:02:35.748
Just do a shift click on all of those JAR files.

55
00:02:35.748 --> 00:02:37.331
Big long list here.

56
00:02:40.396 --> 00:02:42.397
And once you have all those JAR files selected

57
00:02:42.397 --> 00:02:45.761
go ahead and click on the OK button.

58
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.012
And now there should be listed here in the center.

59
00:02:48.012 --> 00:02:49.272
AOK.

60
00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:53.439
And then again in the bottom right click on the OK button.

61
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:56.332
Okay great.

62
00:02:56.332 --> 00:02:58.968
So it does all the setting up, all the scanning and so on.

63
00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:00.933
So now we should have this newer item here called

64
00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:04.300
Reference Libraries which is basically all those JAR files

65
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.374
but now they're actually on our project class path.

66
00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:09.920
Once you have this in place then you're good to go.

67
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.785
Now in the following videos we'll go ahead

68
00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:13.578
and we'll actually start writing code.

69
00:03:13.578 --> 00:03:16.369
But I at least want to get a new project setup from scratch

70
00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.766
just to help us out with our future development.

71
00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.636
Okay so this is good stuff so far.

72
00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:24.219
I'll see you in the next video.
