00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:03.127
<v Instructor>Alright, so we're making good progress here.</v>

2
00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:05.131
Let's take a look at our next two steps.

3
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:07.524
So in step two we're gonna add the component annotation

4
00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:09.042
to our Java class.

5
00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.489
In step three we'll retrieve the bean

6
00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:12.993
from the Spring container.

7
00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:14.089
So a lot of good stuff here.

8
00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.256
Let's go ahead and dig in.

9
00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:19.634
Alright, so what I wanna do is actually create

10
00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:21.545
our coach interface.

11
00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:22.978
So I'll just simply do a right click,

12
00:00:22.978 --> 00:00:24.978
I'll say New, Interface,

13
00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:29.247
and I'll give the interface name of Coach.

14
00:00:29.247 --> 00:00:33.414
I'll keep all the other defaults, and I'll hit Finish.

15
00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.038
And we've already seen the coach interface before

16
00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:38.036
in previous videos,

17
00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:39.753
and I'll just kinda write it here again from scratch,

18
00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:41.658
just to kinda keep things simple

19
00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:43.419
and keep things on track.

20
00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:46.132
So this coach interface will have one simple method

21
00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:47.397
just starting out.

22
00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.730
It's called getDailyWorkout.

23
00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.603
So the getDailyWorkout method returns a string,

24
00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:56.097
and it's a public method, and that's it.

25
00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.100
Again, just very simple.

26
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.325
This is the coach interface,

27
00:00:58.325 --> 00:00:59.940
and then we'll have different implementations

28
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.289
that'll actually implement this given interface.

29
00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.332
But this is enough to kinda get us started for right now.

30
00:01:07.332 --> 00:01:08.331
Alrighty, so now let's go ahead

31
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.691
and create an actual Java class.

32
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:12.939
And we're gonna add an annotation to that class.

33
00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.311
So again, I'll right click on our package name,

34
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:20.311
Spring Demo, I'll say New and I'll choose Class.

35
00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:23.765
And so here we're gonna mix it up a little bit.

36
00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.972
We're gonna create a tennis coach,

37
00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:30.783
so that's the actual name of the class: TennisCoach.

38
00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:31.616
And then what I'd like to do

39
00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:33.699
is move down to the interfaces section

40
00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:35.943
and I like to click on the Add button here

41
00:01:35.943 --> 00:01:40.214
because we want to add an interface for this tennis coach.

42
00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:42.704
And the actual interface we're gonna choose is coach,

43
00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:44.314
so just type in coach up top,

44
00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:45.498
they'll give you that link,

45
00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:48.059
and then there we go, matching items.

46
00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:50.476
And then go ahead and hit OK.

47
00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:55.671
Great, so in Interfaces section you should see

48
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:57.456
the coach interface listed.

49
00:01:57.456 --> 00:02:02.054
Let's keep all the other defaults, and then hit Finish.

50
00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:03.054
Okay, this is great.

51
00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:04.248
So this is what our coach should look like right now

52
00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:05.963
for our tennis coach.

53
00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:08.061
Let's go ahead and give ourselves

54
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.196
a basic implementation here

55
00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:12.779
for a tennis coach for their daily workout.

56
00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:16.674
Let's just kind of dream up something.

57
00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:19.653
Practice your backhand volley.

58
00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:20.774
Yeah, that sounds about right.

59
00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:21.772
(chuckles)

60
00:02:21.772 --> 00:02:23.273
Alright, so that's the implementation here

61
00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:24.295
for our tennis coach.

62
00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:25.602
So these are the daily workouts

63
00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:28.596
that the tennis coach will provide when we ask him

64
00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:31.546
as far as, hey coach, what do we need to do today?

65
00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:33.854
Practice your backhand volley.

66
00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:34.852
Okay, great.

67
00:02:34.852 --> 00:02:36.007
So now the next thing we need to do

68
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:38.494
is add the annotation here.

69
00:02:38.494 --> 00:02:41.997
So we need to add that @Component annotation.

70
00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:44.410
So again, this is a special annotation that Spring will use

71
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.365
when they scan our classes,

72
00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:50.532
and then I'll give the actual bean ID of thatSillyCoach.

73
00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:54.233
So kind of hover over the @Component

74
00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:57.523
so we can fix the imports here.

75
00:02:57.523 --> 00:03:01.690
So I just select the option therefore of Import Component.

76
00:03:07.022 --> 00:03:09.470
And on line three we should have

77
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.224
org.springframework.stereotype.Component.

78
00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.226
Great, this is good.

79
00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:17.143
So that's the correct import that we need here.

80
00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.450
So again, when Spring scans this package,

81
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.455
they're gonna find this class, @Component,

82
00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:26.656
they're gonna automatically register this bean

83
00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:27.724
with the Spring container,

84
00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:30.888
and they'll use the bean ID of thatSillyCoach

85
00:03:30.888 --> 00:03:32.821
so at a later time we can retrieve that bean

86
00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:34.266
from the Spring container

87
00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:37.266
using the bean ID of thatSillyCoach.

88
00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:41.610
Alright, so we're making some really good progress here.

89
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.621
So with step three, we need to write the code

90
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:45.545
to retrieve the bean from the container.

91
00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:49.712
So I'll actually create another Java class for this.

92
00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:55.229
I'll choose right click, I'll say New Class.

93
00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.826
And the name for this class, I'll call it AnnotationDemoApp.

94
00:04:01.954 --> 00:04:05.010
And this is just a main driver program.

95
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.349
It'll actually have a main method,

96
00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.516
so I'll select the option here at the bottom for main,

97
00:04:12.303 --> 00:04:14.474
and I'll keep all the other defaults here,

98
00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:16.557
and then I'll hit Finish.

99
00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:21.258
Okay, good, so just a very...

100
00:04:21.258 --> 00:04:22.821
Simple application here.

101
00:04:22.821 --> 00:04:25.229
Let me go ahead and clean up those auto-generated comments,

102
00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.756
and let me write in my own comments

103
00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:28.758
as far as the things that I wanna do

104
00:04:28.758 --> 00:04:30.758
inside of this demo app.

105
00:04:34.637 --> 00:04:35.659
So the first thing I'm gonna do

106
00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.530
is read the Spring config file,

107
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.246
then I'll get the bean from the Spring container,

108
00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:43.894
I'll call some methods on the bean,

109
00:04:43.894 --> 00:04:46.922
and then finally, I'll close the container.

110
00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:48.368
And again, this is nothing really new.

111
00:04:48.368 --> 00:04:51.763
We've actually gone through this process many times before,

112
00:04:51.763 --> 00:04:52.838
and we'll do a similar thing here

113
00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:56.338
with the Spring annotation configurations.

114
00:04:57.726 --> 00:05:00.000
Alright, so let's go ahead and start writing some code here.

115
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.579
So again, reading the Spring config file,

116
00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:03.704
just like we've already done.

117
00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:05.118
Give myself some white space at the bottom.

118
00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:06.109
So here I'll just make use

119
00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:09.359
of that ClassPathXMLApplicationContext.

120
00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:14.164
Context equals new.

121
00:05:14.164 --> 00:05:16.306
And again, I like to copy paste that name.

122
00:05:16.306 --> 00:05:19.051
So I just copy that name and paste it.

123
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:20.251
I use the keyboard there.

124
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:21.955
And then I give the actual name of the config file,

125
00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:24.348
so applicationContext.xml, and that's it.

126
00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:27.407
And again, remember, our XML file is really simple.

127
00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:28.643
There's not much in there.

128
00:05:28.643 --> 00:05:32.495
It simply tells Spring to scan for beans.

129
00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:35.662
I'll go ahead and fix my imports here.

130
00:05:36.524 --> 00:05:39.176
Goes on line three, we should have the correct import.

131
00:05:39.176 --> 00:05:40.759
So that looks good.

132
00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:43.767
Get the bean from the container.

133
00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:46.850
And again, we simply use the bean ID.

134
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.535
So let me just take a quick peek.

135
00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:53.939
So in TennisCoach, the bean ID is thatSillyCoach.

136
00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:55.865
ThatSillyCoach!

137
00:05:55.865 --> 00:05:56.698
So I just copy it

138
00:05:56.698 --> 00:05:58.953
just so I have it in my little buffer here.

139
00:05:58.953 --> 00:06:02.182
And now I'll just go through and read the bean.

140
00:06:02.182 --> 00:06:03.437
So Coach, the Coach equals,

141
00:06:03.437 --> 00:06:05.854
and I'll say context.getBean,

142
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.614
and I'll just do a little paste here

143
00:06:08.614 --> 00:06:11.185
of the actual bean ID,

144
00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:12.696
what I just copied.

145
00:06:12.696 --> 00:06:14.065
So I'll just do a paste.

146
00:06:14.065 --> 00:06:16.315
And then comma Coach.class.

147
00:06:17.185 --> 00:06:19.901
So again, remember, when you have that @Component

148
00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:21.169
on the actual tennis coach,

149
00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.812
you simply use whatever bean ID they provided,

150
00:06:23.812 --> 00:06:25.547
and that's what you do to retrieve it, and that's it.

151
00:06:25.547 --> 00:06:26.535
Very simple.

152
00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:28.226
So this is all good stuff.

153
00:06:28.226 --> 00:06:30.274
Everything that we're gonna do from the remaining here

154
00:06:30.274 --> 00:06:31.797
is what you've seen already.

155
00:06:31.797 --> 00:06:32.957
So there's nothing really new.

156
00:06:32.957 --> 00:06:35.340
So simply call the method on the bean.

157
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.470
TheCoach.getDailyWorkout, which is all good.

158
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.545
And then I simply close off the context

159
00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:42.628
by doing a context.close.

160
00:06:47.968 --> 00:06:49.765
Alright, so that's really all the work for step three

161
00:06:49.765 --> 00:06:52.760
of retrieving the bean from the container.

162
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.109
We just went through and read the config file,

163
00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:59.061
got the bean, called a method on the bean,

164
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:00.621
and then finally closed the context.

165
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:02.462
So this looks really good, so let's go ahead and save this

166
00:07:02.462 --> 00:07:06.499
and let's go ahead and run this application.

167
00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:10.666
I'll just do a right click, Run As, Java Application.

168
00:07:12.407 --> 00:07:15.567
And then voila, there's our output!

169
00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:18.222
So it goes through, it says loading bean configurations

170
00:07:18.222 --> 00:07:20.592
from that applicationContext.xml.

171
00:07:20.592 --> 00:07:22.621
So this guy goes through and scans everything.

172
00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:24.144
It registers those beans,

173
00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:25.820
and then we simply call a method on it,

174
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.783
print out our daily workout, practice your backhand volley,

175
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.668
and we close it and that's it.

176
00:07:31.668 --> 00:07:32.501
There you go.

177
00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:36.426
So you've used Spring annotations in a Java application

178
00:07:36.426 --> 00:07:38.466
so you can kinda check that off your list.

179
00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:40.450
We're actually gonna go in detail

180
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.304
and cover some more aspects of this,

181
00:07:42.304 --> 00:07:44.905
but you've kind of covered the basics so far.

182
00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:46.112
So I'd say, good job!

183
00:07:46.112 --> 00:07:47.222
Congratulations!

184
00:07:47.222 --> 00:07:48.055
Yoo-hoo!
