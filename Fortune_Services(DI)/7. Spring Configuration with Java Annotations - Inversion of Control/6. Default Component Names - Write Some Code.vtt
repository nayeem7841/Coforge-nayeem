00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:02.552
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:04.779
and move into Eclipse, and what we're going to do

3
00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.275
is actually go through the demo

4
00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:09.816
of using default bean ids with Spring,

5
00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:11.583
and what I'd like to do is continue

6
00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:13.198
to use an existing project,

7
00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:14.439
and we're going to make some modifications

8
00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.166
to our TennisCoach,

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.015
and what we're going to do actually with this TennisCoach

10
00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:20.763
is that we're actually going to remove

11
00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:24.236
the explicit bean id from that class,

12
00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:26.886
so right now on line five I give the explicit bean id

13
00:00:26.886 --> 00:00:29.983
of thatSillyCoach, and what I want to do

14
00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:31.816
is actually remove it.

15
00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:36.789
We want to have Spring linkings of the default bean id,

16
00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.841
so I'll just simply highlight this whole section here

17
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.616
of that explicit bean id, and I'll just hit the delete key

18
00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:45.763
to actually remove this from my TennisCoach,

19
00:00:45.763 --> 00:00:47.930
from my TennisCoach class.

20
00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.894
Alright so there we go, so now just add component.

21
00:00:51.894 --> 00:00:54.446
Note here that this will now use the default bean id

22
00:00:54.446 --> 00:00:56.666
because we didn't explicitly give one,

23
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.162
and remember the default bean id

24
00:00:58.162 --> 00:00:59.962
is the same name as the class except

25
00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:03.212
that the first character is lower case.

26
00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:07.753
Alright, so now let's go ahead and move

27
00:01:07.753 --> 00:01:09.634
into our actual application because we'll need

28
00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:10.932
to make some changes to our app

29
00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:13.849
when we actually retrieve the bean.

30
00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:18.636
So here's my annotation demo app,

31
00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:24.060
and I'm going to move down to lines 13 and 14,

32
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.804
so this is where we actually get the bean

33
00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:28.738
from the Spring container, and I'm going to modify

34
00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:32.747
this code now to actually use the default bean id,

35
00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:36.172
so instead of using thatSillyCoach,

36
00:01:36.172 --> 00:01:39.755
I'm actually going to remove this reference

37
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:45.007
and instead I'll use the default bean id,

38
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:47.759
tennisCoach, again same name as the class,

39
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.336
the first character is lowercase.

40
00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:52.240
So that'll actually retrieve this bean

41
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.608
from the Spring container, then I can use it

42
00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:56.858
later on in my application.

43
00:01:57.836 --> 00:02:01.925
Alright, so this looks pretty good so far.

44
00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:04.017
Alright so let's go ahead and save this application.

45
00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:05.643
Let's go ahead and run it.

46
00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:07.661
So I'll simply do my right click,

47
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:11.828
I choose run as, I choose run as a Java application.

48
00:02:14.478 --> 00:02:15.709
Okay great, so it's up and running.

49
00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.209
Here's our output.

50
00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.701
So we read the information from the configuration file.

51
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:23.336
It does the component scanning, and good,

52
00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.449
so we get our output, practice your backhand volley,

53
00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.028
so this is good, so it means that hey,

54
00:02:27.028 --> 00:02:29.823
it found the bean and we were able to call our method on,

55
00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:30.845
so this is all good,

56
00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:33.295
so the use of that default bean id

57
00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:36.781
worked out just fine for us, and that's great.

58
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.232
I'm kind of happy about that.

59
00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:41.123
But I want to try and break some things here.

60
00:02:41.123 --> 00:02:44.543
When everything runs fine, you're like okay, cool,

61
00:02:44.543 --> 00:02:46.266
it's fine, but let's try and break it,

62
00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.657
and the way I'm going to try and break this

63
00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:52.698
is that when I get the bean from the Spring container,

64
00:02:52.698 --> 00:02:55.561
instead of using the default id,

65
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:57.644
I'm actually going to use thatSillyCoach.

66
00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:00.313
That's what I had before.

67
00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.451
I'm going to use thatSillyCoach,

68
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.451
but our TennisCoach doesn't have thatSillyCoach.

69
00:03:06.944 --> 00:03:08.427
They're simply using the default id,

70
00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:11.353
so here I'm trying to call thatSillyCoach,

71
00:03:11.353 --> 00:03:15.160
you know, trying to break things here, okay.

72
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.961
So let's run this and let's see what all happens,

73
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:21.461
so right click, run as a Java application.

74
00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:26.204
And it's running and then it kind of blows up on us,

75
00:03:26.204 --> 00:03:29.862
you know, with the exception and this ugly stack trace.

76
00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:30.862
Aye aye aye.

77
00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:33.252
Alright, let's see what the problem is.

78
00:03:33.252 --> 00:03:36.503
Oh, no such bean definition, so no bean named

79
00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:38.708
thatSillyCoach is a find.

80
00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:42.540
Hmm, so the explicit name is not given on the class,

81
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.439
so that means when Spring does the component scanning,

82
00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.204
the bean is registered with its default bean id,

83
00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:52.185
so in our code we'd have to use a default bean id

84
00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:53.961
to actually retrieve it.

85
00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:56.491
Ah, okay so that's it, but this is really good.

86
00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:58.000
I'm glad you're seeing this error now

87
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.465
because you may see this when you write

88
00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:01.290
some of your other Spring applications.

89
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.902
You have to make sure you use the correct name

90
00:04:02.902 --> 00:04:06.385
when you retreat it, so here back in my code,

91
00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:09.707
I'm going back and I'm putting in the default bean id

92
00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:13.545
of tennisCoach, just to make sure that everything

93
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:16.661
will work properly because it's actually defined

94
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:18.828
using the default bean id.

95
00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:21.839
Right click, run as, Java app,

96
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.802
and this time everything's going to work out just fine

97
00:04:23.802 --> 00:04:25.322
for us, just like it did earlier

98
00:04:25.322 --> 00:04:27.761
when we first ran the application,

99
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.106
so it found the bean and it printed out the method

100
00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:31.973
and so on, so again, just make sure you use

101
00:04:31.973 --> 00:04:35.400
the correct bean id when you write your application,

102
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.498
so either a explicit bean id or the default bean id,

103
00:04:39.498 --> 00:04:42.598
and it all depends on how that bean is actually defined,

104
00:04:42.598 --> 00:04:44.200
and you can always find this out

105
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.861
by simply looking at the source code

106
00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:47.403
and looking at the definition

107
00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:50.514
of the at component annotation.

108
00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:51.983
Alright, so hopefully you enjoyed this.

109
00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:53.346
We showed you the happy path

110
00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:55.849
and then I also showed you what will happen

111
00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.177
if I break it and we run into errors,

112
00:04:58.177 --> 00:05:00.320
and then finally how to put it all back together

113
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.834
and resolve it.

114
00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.018
Okay great.

115
00:05:03.018 --> 00:05:05.536
So these are some really good tips and tricks for you.

116
00:05:05.536 --> 00:05:07.499
You were successful here in making use

117
00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:08.900
of the default bean id,

118
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.399
and I say congratulations and I will see you

119
00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:12.899
in the next video.
