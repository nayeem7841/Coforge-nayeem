00:00:00.662 --> 00:00:02.891
<v Instructor>All righty, so let's go ahead and move in</v>

2
00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:04.963
and let's walk through this development process.

3
00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:06.930
So the first step is that we're actually gonna

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.097
enable component scanning in our Spring configuration file.

5
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:16.272
All right, so moving into our Eclipse project

6
00:00:16.272 --> 00:00:19.028
that we just created, that spring-demo-annotation,

7
00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:22.860 line:15% 
what I wanna do is actually copy over the config file

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.027 line:15% 
from our previous project.

9
00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:29.023 line:15% 
So what I wanna do is actually move into my

10
00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:32.278 line:15% 
spring-demo-one project, and I'm actually gonna copy

11
00:00:32.278 --> 00:00:35.718 line:15% 
the applicationContext.xml and I'll move it to my new one.

12
00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:39.388 line:15% 
So in spring-demo-one, selection applicationContext.xml,

13
00:00:39.388 --> 00:00:42.138 line:15% 
do a right-click and choose Copy.

14
00:00:44.653 --> 00:00:47.394 line:15% 
And now let's move back to our spring-demo-annotation,

15
00:00:47.394 --> 00:00:48.662 line:15% 
that's the one that we just created,

16
00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:51.972 line:15% 
and let's simply move to the source directory,

17
00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:55.500 line:15% 
and then we do a right-click and choose Paste.

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.333 line:15% 
And it's important that you paste it

19
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.408 line:15% 
into the source directory.

20
00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:01.075 line:15% 
So right-click and choose Paste.

21
00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:04.518
Okay, great, now if we expand the source directory

22
00:01:04.518 --> 00:01:06.864
for spring-demo-annotations, we should see this new

23
00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:10.905
config file here, applicationContext.xml.

24
00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:12.800
Let's go ahead and open this file up for a second

25
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.550
and just take a quick look at it.

26
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:19.642
I'll just expand the window here.

27
00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:22.327
Now, what I actually wanna do is clean out this file,

28
00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:24.930 line:15% 
so I wanna remove all the bean entries in this file,

29
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.607 line:15% 
so simply highlight everything there

30
00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:28.016 line:15% 
for all the bean entries,

31
00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:31.349 line:15% 
I'll do a right-click and choose Delete.

32
00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:34.773
So at this point we should have everything deleted

33
00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:36.844
from this file, we should only have what I have here,

34
00:01:36.844 --> 00:01:38.566
on the screen, so kinda use this as a checkpoint

35
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.816
to make sure your file looks like mine.

36
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.989
All right, and also I like to clean up,

37
00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:48.928
so let's go ahead and close that previous project we had,

38
00:01:48.928 --> 00:01:50.827
spring-demo-one, that's the old one,

39
00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:53.216
so let's just simply do a right-click and choose Close

40
00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:54.549
on that project.

41
00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:02.204
Because I like to kinda keep things simple,

42
00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:03.961
make sure I only have one project at a time,

43
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.192 line:15% 
make sure I'm only editing a given file at a time,

44
00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:09.149 line:15% 
because you get mixed up with too much stuff.

45
00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.043 line:15% 
So step one is that we're gonna enable component scanning

46
00:02:12.043 --> 00:02:13.611 line:15% 
in our Spring config file.

47
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:16.219 line:15% 
So let's go into our applicationContext.xml,

48
00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.726
let's move down to line 10,

49
00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:20.535
and I'll add a quick little comment here,

50
00:02:20.535 --> 00:02:22.394
just to kinda keep myself on track.

51
00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:26.561
So I'm gonna add an entry to enable component scanning.

52
00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.109
And then I'll actually add the code here on line 12,

53
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.625
so I'll say context: and I'll choose component-scan,

54
00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:42.624
that's the same thing we saw on the slides earlier,

55
00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:44.619
and then I'll give the actual base package name,

56
00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.950
so I'll call it com.Luv2code.springdemo.

57
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.813
And I'll just put a slash here at the end,

58
00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:51.692
just to get that taken care of.

59
00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:52.775
So that's it really.

60
00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:55.121
So context:component-scan, we give the base package

61
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:56.957
and we give the actual name of our package

62
00:02:56.957 --> 00:02:59.322
of where we're gonna place code.

63
00:02:59.322 --> 00:03:01.308
And so again, Spring will do all the scanning,

64
00:03:01.308 --> 00:03:02.769
look for those annotations,

65
00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.815
and then register those beans automatically.

66
00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:08.943 line:15% 
All right, now while I'm here let's go ahead and create

67
00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:11.582 line:15% 
the package since we remember the package name,

68
00:03:11.582 --> 00:03:13.386 line:15% 
let's go ahead and create it real quick.

69
00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:14.747 line:15% 
So in our source directory,

70
00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:17.948 line:15% 
let's simply do a right-click, choose New,

71
00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:20.448 line:15% 
and then we'll choose Package.

72
00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:24.037
And I'll give the actual package name,

73
00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.706
it's com.Luv2code.springdemo, you have to make sure

74
00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.106
it's the exact same package name that you reference

75
00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:32.564
in the Spring config file, 'cause this is where

76
00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:36.397
Spring's gonna scan, looking for Spring beans.

77
00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:39.178
So I'll hit Finish, and there we go,

78
00:03:39.178 --> 00:03:41.837
we have this new package, com.Luv2code.springdemo,

79
00:03:41.837 --> 00:03:44.186
I'll just look at my config file and make sure

80
00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:46.910
those two names are the same.

81
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.956
So this looks good.

82
00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:50.345
So we have step one completed so far,

83
00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:52.259
so we have the component scanning in place.

84
00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.612
In the following video we'll actually start writing code,

85
00:03:54.612 --> 00:03:56.985
and we'll follow those two additional steps

86
00:03:56.985 --> 00:03:59.547
required for this configuration process.

87
00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:01.630
So I'll see you in a bit.
